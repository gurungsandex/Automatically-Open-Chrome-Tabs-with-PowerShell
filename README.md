# **Automatically Open All Your Morning Chrome Tabs with PowerShell**

Are you bored or is it time-consuming to open all those tabs sometimes more than 10 or 20 browser tabs when you start your morning at work? 

If that is the scenario, here is a PowerShell script which you can just run, and it will **automatically open all your required browser tabs**. 

This saves time. Automation is the trend now. If we have the technology or trick, why not give it a try?

I have provided a **step-by-step easy guide** and **full PowerShell script**, ready to run. 

Give it a try and feel free to recommend improvements!

## **Step 1: Prepare URLs**

1. Create a folder for this automation, e.g., `C:\Automation\MorningWorkspace`.
2. Inside, create a file called `urls.txt`.
3. Add all your required URLs (websites), one per line in "urls.txt" file. Lines starting with `#` are ignored.

Example:

```
https://outlook.office.com
https://teams.microsoft.com
https://servicenow.company.com
```

## **Step 2: Save the Script**

1. Create a `MorningChromeLauncher.ps1` PowerShell file **in the same folder** as `urls.txt` and Copy the following script into the PowerShell file.

```powershell
# MorningChromeLauncher.ps1
# Opens all URLs from urls.txt in Chrome automatically

$UrlFile = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "urls.txt"
$ChromeRunningOption = "A"
$DelayIfChromeRunning = 0.3
$DelayIfChromeClosed = 0

function Get-ChromePath {
    $paths = @("$Env:ProgramFiles\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe", "$Env:ProgramFiles(x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe")
    foreach ($path in $paths) { if (Test-Path $path) { return $path } }
    return $null
}

function Get-ChromeProfiles {
    $UserDataDir = "$Env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data"
    if (!(Test-Path $UserDataDir)) { return @("Default") }
    $profiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $UserDataDir -Directory | Where-Object { $_.Name -match "Default|Profile" } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
    if ($profiles.Count -eq 0) { return @("Default") }
    return $profiles
}

function Select-ChromeProfile {
    $profiles = Get-ChromeProfiles
    Write-Host "Available Chrome Profiles:"
    for ($i=0; $i -lt $profiles.Count; $i++) { Write-Host "$($i+1) - $($profiles[$i])" }
    $choice = Read-Host "Enter choice (number)"
    if ($choice -match '^\d+$' -and $choice -ge 1 -and $choice -le $profiles.Count) { return $profiles[$choice-1] }
    else { Write-Host "Invalid choice. Using Default profile."; return "Default" }
}

function Get-Urls {
    if (!(Test-Path $UrlFile)) { Write-Host "URL file not found: $UrlFile"; exit }
    return Get-Content $UrlFile | Where-Object { $_ -and -not $_.StartsWith("#") }
}

Write-Host "Morning Chrome Workspace Launcher"
$ChromePath = Get-ChromePath
if (!$ChromePath) { Write-Host "Google Chrome not found."; exit }
$Profile = Select-ChromeProfile
$Urls = Get-Urls
if ($Urls.Count -eq 0) { Write-Host "No URLs found."; exit }
$ChromeRunning = Get-Process chrome -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if ($ChromeRunning) {
    Write-Host "Chrome already running."
    if ($ChromeRunningOption -eq "B") { Write-Host "Option B: No new tabs."; exit }
    if ($ChromeRunningOption -eq "C") { Start-Process $ChromePath "--new-window --profile-directory=$Profile" }
    $Delay = $DelayIfChromeRunning
} else {
    Start-Process $ChromePath "--profile-directory=$Profile"
    Start-Sleep 2
    $Delay = $DelayIfChromeClosed
}
foreach ($url in $Urls) { Start-Process $ChromePath "--profile-directory=$Profile $url"; if ($Delay -gt 0) { Start-Sleep -Seconds $Delay } }
Write-Host "All tabs launched."
```

## **Step 3: Allow Scripts to Run**

Run **once** in PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Press `Y` to confirm.

---

## **Step 4: Run the Script**

```powershell
cd C:\Automation\MorningWorkspace
.\MorningChromeLauncher.ps1
```

1. Choose the Chrome profile from the list.
2. Chrome will open and load all your URLs automatically.

---

## **Step 5: Desktop Shortcut**

1. Right-click desktop → **New → Shortcut**
2. Location:

```
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Automation\MorningWorkspace\MorningChromeLauncher.ps1"
```

3. Name it `Morning Workspace`.
4. Double-click it every morning — all tabs open automatically.

---

## **Step 6: Update URLs**

Edit `urls.txt` to add or remove URLs. Next time you run the script, the changes are applied.

---

This is short, easy to follow, and fully functional for anyone to get started with **PowerShell-based morning workspace automation**.

---

If you want, I can also **make it an even shorter “1-page GitHub README style”** with all commands and script blocks inlined, perfect for copy-paste without extra explanation.

Do you want me to do that?
